Change log for Hold It!
=======================

Version 1.1.0
-------------

* At the request of the circulation desk, make it include books marked as "lost" in addition to those marked "on shelf", because apparently patrons sometimes put holds on lost books
* Fix bug in algorithm that computes differences in the new requests versus past requests in the Google spreadsheet
* Rename from _Holdit!_ to _Hold It!_, because it's better that way
